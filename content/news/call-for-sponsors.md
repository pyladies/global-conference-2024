## Join us! Become a sponsor of the second edition of the Global PyLadies conference!

We are busy planning the 2024 edition of the Global PyLadies Conference, and we’d like to invite you to help support our event.

As you know, PyLadies is active around the world, with over 200 chapters on every continent (well, almost - sorry, Antarctica!) helping to provide women with mentorship, training, and conference grants. Those initiatives help build the diversity of our Python communities everywhere by building a bridge to Python development and open source contributions.

## Help make this edition of the global PyLadies conference a reality

The conference again will be fully online, and run entirely by volunteers. We are intentionally making it free, online, inclusive, and accessible, so that as many of our members as possible can benefit from it in order to further advance their careers. Your sponsorship of the Global PyLadies Conference will make it possible to offer that experience to women everywhere. And by being a sponsor you and your company will gain exposure to PyLadies and Pythonistas around the world as partners in our mission to include more women in Python and open source.

**If you’re interested in supporting our work,** you can check out the options in our sponsor prospectus now available at [https://conference.pyladies.com/sponsors](https://conference.pyladies.com/sponsors), or you can get in touch with our sponsorship team at sponsors@pyladies.com.

In addition to tax deductibility as a marketing expense for our sponsors, any applicable benefits of the PSF’s 501©3 designation from the IRS also may apply.
